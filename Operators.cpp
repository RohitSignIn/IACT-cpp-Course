// C++ Operators

    /*
    Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
    In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

    C++ divides the operators into the following groups:
    1.Arithmetic operators
    2.Assignment operators
    3.Comparison operators
    4.Logical operators
    5.Bitwise operators
    */

// Arithmetic Operators
    /*
    +	Addition	    Adds together two values	x + y	
    -	Subtraction	    Subtracts one value from another	x - y	
    *	Multiplication	Multiplies two values	x * y	
    /	Division	    Divides one value by another	x / y	
    %	Modulus	        Returns the division remainder	x % y	
    ++	Increment	    Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x	
    --	Decrement	    Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x
    */


// Assignment Operator
    /*
    =	x = 5	x = 5	
    +=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
    -=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
    *=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
    /=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
    %=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
    &=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
    |=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
    ^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
    >>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
    <<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3
    */

// Comparison Operator
    /* 
A list of all comparison operators:


    ==	Equal to	x == y	
    !=	Not equal	x != y	
    >	Greater than	x > y	
    <	Less than	x < y	
    >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
    <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

    */

// Logial Operator
/* 

&& 	Logical and	Returns true if both statements are true	x < 5 &&  x < 10	
|| 	Logical or	Returns true if one of the statements is true	x < 5 || x < 4	
!	Logical not	Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	!(x < 5 && x < 10)
